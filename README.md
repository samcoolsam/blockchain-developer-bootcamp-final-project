# Final Project Idea

A DAPP called "PetWorld" - where
1. Government/VetServices can register Vets (de-registering vets is out of scope).
2. Vets can register pets (when they insert a chip).
3. Vets can delete pets (upon death).
4. Owners can gift their pets to others for free.
5. Anyone (but the existing owner) can buy a pet which is available for sale by providing exact or more funds. Excess will be refunded.
6. Only current pet owners can update their pet details to set a price and enable/disable them for sale.
7.

# How to run local tests

2. cd to the directory where the code is cloned
3. Port for local test net : 8545
4. Run "truffle test" - all unit tests should ideally pass.
