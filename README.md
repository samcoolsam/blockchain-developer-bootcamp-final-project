# Final Project Idea

A DAPP called "PetWorld" - where
1. Government/VetServices can register and de-register Vets.
2. Vets can register pets (when they insert a chip)
3. Owners can sell or gift their pets to others.
4. Any pet's owner details can be immutably saved and retreived.
5. Vets can delete pets (upon death)
